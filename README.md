A look at the for of loop, which we'll use in the next screencast.
```
for (const name of names) {
    // console.log(name);
}

```

## flexbox
### justify-content
- The CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content">justify-content property</a> defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.
```
/* Positional alignment */
justify-content: center;     /* Pack items around the center */
justify-content: start;      /* Pack items from the start */
justify-content: end;        /* Pack items from the end */
justify-content: flex-start; /* Pack flex items from the start */
justify-content: flex-end;   /* Pack flex items from the end */
justify-content: left;       /* Pack items from the left */
justify-content: right;      /* Pack items from the right */
```
